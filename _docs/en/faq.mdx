## General

#### Q. Can I use the extension without any knowledge of HTML or CSS selectors?

No special knowledge is required to use the keyword block feature.  
Knowledge of HTML and CSS selectors may be required only when you want to customize the behavior of the keyword block to your liking.

---

#### Q. If I purchase the mobile version, will it work on both iOS and iPadOS?

Yes, it will work on both.

---

#### Q. Is the mobile version a subscription?

It is offered on a Lifetime Plan. There are no monthly fees.

---

#### Q. Does an Android version exist?

The Android version is not supported because browser extensions are not available for the Android version of Chrome.

---

#### Q. Can I integrate with clouds other than Dropbox?

Currently, only Dropbox is supported.

## How does the app work?

#### Q. I want to change the emoji that hides elements and text

You can set your favorite emoji in the `EmoGuardian` section of the Options page.

---

#### Q. I want to turn off the extension on a specific site

Please open EmoGuard at the site where you want to turn off the extension and click the Power button to turn it off.

---

#### Q. I want to always display the keyword list

Please enable `Always show keyword list` on the Options page.

---

#### Q. Can I manage keywords by site?

Sorry, EmoGuard does not have the feature to manage keywords by site.

---

#### Q. What is a "Recommended CSS Selector"?

It is a pre-setup CSS selector that allows user to use the keyword blocking feature out of the box.
It is tuned to work on popular and well-known major sites.  
Use of the Recommended CSS Selector is optional, and even if you do use it, you can freely customize the setting values.

---

#### Q. There is a CSS selector that cannot be deleted

The recommended CSS selector cannot be deleted.  
If you wish to disable the recommended CSS selectors, click on the eye icon to `Show` them individually, or go to `Recommended CSS selector settings` on the Options page and disable the relevant ones.

---

#### Q. What is the CSS selector's hiding mode?

The hiding mode is an item for specifying "how to hide the target".  
You can choose whether to hide the element or the text when a keyword is matched.

---

#### Q. What is the CSS selector's search mode?

The search mode is for specifying "how to search for keywords".

- Shallow Search: Search for keywords **in the direct text of element** matching the CSS selector
- Deep Search: Search for keywords **in the text of elements and its descendants** matching the CSS selector

---

#### Q. "Deep Search" in search mode is not displayed and cannot be selected

Deep Search can be selected only when the hiding mode is set to `Hide text matching keywords`.

---

#### Q. What does the xxx icon mean?

Basically, extension icons and buttons show a tooltip when you mouse over them for a few seconds to read a hint.  
In the case of the mobile version, a long press will display a tooltip as well.

---

#### Q. I don't want to display elements or text for a moment

Please adjust the `Keyword Block Speed` slider on the Options page to move it toward the `Fast` side.  
This will shorten the time it takes for the element or text to be hidden, but the browser may become slower.

---

#### Q. Web pages load slowly or run sluggishly

Please adjust the `Keyword Block Speed` slider on the Options page to move it toward the `Slow` side.  
This will lengthen the time it takes for the element or text to be hidden, but the browser may become faster.

---

#### Q. The display of certain websites is broken

Please try the following workaround.

- Change CSS selector settings
- Delete the relevant CSS selector
- Reset the recommended CSS selector
- Turn off extensions on that site

---

#### Q. Emojis on a web page may not disappear after removing CSS selectors or keywords

Since EmoGuard runs immediately after a web page starts loading, in rare cases it may conflict with the behavior of the framework used in the web page.  
In such cases, reloading the page will remove the emoji.

---

#### Q. There are sites where the extension does not work

Although EmoGuard is designed to work without problems in most places, unfortunately there may be sites where it does not work well.  
Websites are created using a wide variety of technologies, and it is a technically difficult task to support them all.

EmoGuard does not guarantee that it will work on all sites, but we will do our best to try to adapt to them as much as possible.
