## General

No special knowledge is required to use the keyword block feature.  
Knowledge of HTML and CSS selectors may be required only when you want to customize the behavior of your extension.

Yes, it will work on both.

---

#### Q. Is the mobile version a subscription?

It is offered on a Lifetime Plan. There are no monthly fees.

---

#### Q. Does an Android version exist?

The Android version is not supported because browser extensions are not available for the Android version of Chrome.

---

#### Q. Can I integrate with cloud services other than Dropbox?

Currently, only Dropbox is supported.

#### Q. I want to always display the keyword list

Please enable `Always show keyword list` on the Options page.

---

#### Q. Can I manage keywords by site?

Sorry, EmoGuard does not have the feature to manage keywords by site.

---

#### Q. What is "Default CSS Selector"?

It is a pre-setup CSS selector that allows user to use the keyword blocking feature out of the box.  
It is tuned to work on popular and well-known major sites.  
Use of the Default CSS Selector is optional, and even if you do use it, you can freely customize the setting values.

---

#### Q. There is a CSS selector that cannot be deleted

The default CSS selector cannot be deleted.  
If you wish to disable the default CSS selectors, click on the eye icon to `Show` them individually, or go to `Default CSS Selectors Settings` on the Options page and disable the relevant ones.

---

#### Q. What is the CSS selector's hiding mode?

The hiding mode is an item for specifying "how to hide text or elements".  
You can choose to hide the entire element or just the text when a keyword is matched on a web page.

---

#### Q. What is the CSS selector's search mode?

The search mode is for specifying "how to search for keywords".

- Shallow Search: Search for keywords **in the direct text of element** matching the CSS selector
- Deep Search: Search for keywords **in the text of elements and its descendants** matching the CSS selector

---

#### Q. "Deep Search" is not displayed in the search mode menu

Deep Search can be selected only when the hiding mode is set to `Hide text matching keywords`.

---

#### Q. What does the xxx icon mean?

Hover your mouse over the extension icon or button for a few seconds to see hints and usage instructions.  
In the case of the mobile version, a long press will display a tooltip as well.

---

#### Q. I don't want to display elements or text for a moment

Please adjust the `Keyword Block Speed` slider on the Options page to move it toward the `Fast` side.  
This will shorten the time it takes for the element or text to be hidden, but the browser may become slower.

---

#### Q. Web pages load slowly or run sluggishly

Please adjust the `Keyword Block Speed` slider on the Options page to move it toward the `Slow` side.  
This will lengthen the time it takes for the element or text to be hidden, but the browser may become faster.

---

#### Q. The display of certain websites is broken

Please try the following workaround.

- Reload the page
- Change the relevant CSS selector settings
- Delete the relevant CSS selector
- Reset the default CSS selector
- Turn off extensions on that site

---

#### Q. Emojis on a web page may not disappear after removing CSS selectors or keywords

Since EmoGuard runs immediately after a web page starts loading, in rare cases it may conflict with the behavior of the framework used in the web page.  
In such cases, please reload the page to remove the emojis or turn off extensions on the site.

---

#### Q. There are sites where the extension does not work

EmoGuard is designed to work with most websites, but unfortunately it's not perfect.  
The web is created with a wide variety of technologies, and it is technically and practically difficult to support all of them.

EmoGuard is not guaranteed to work with every site, but we are continuing to tune it to work with as many websites as possible.
