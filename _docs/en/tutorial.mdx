Let's get started!  
Install EmoGuard from the following stores for your device.

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emoguard-keyword-blocker/jgjkefnbeaoejcbpfggcggicconjfldd)
- [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoguard/id6443750638?mt=12&itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200)
- [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoguard-keyword-blocker/id6443750571?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200)

## Hide keywords

Let's hide the keywords for a test.  
Look at the following fruit list.

- üçé Apples are red
- üçå Bananas are yellow
- üçá Grapes are purple
- üçä Oranges are orange

**Open EmoGuard on this page** and add your keyword by typing `Apples` in the `Enter any Keyword` text field on the Keywords tab.  
Congratulations! The top item containing `Apples` should now be hidden with an emoji.

That's all there is to basic usage.  
You can hide text or elements you don't want to see on almost any site without any additional configuration.

## Customize how to hide

<Alert status="info" variant="left-accent" my={5}>

  From here we will be dealing with CSS selectors; you don't need to know anything about CSS selectors
  to go through the tutorial, but if there is anything you want to know, you can learn about them [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)
  or look up the term on the web.
</Alert>

Remove the `Apples` you just added to the keyword list.  
The hidden text should appear.

Now let's look again at the previous fruit list.

- üçé Apples are red
- üçå Bananas are yellow
- üçá Grapes are purple
- üçä Oranges are orange

The only keyword specified was `Apples`, but even the unspecified `are red` were hidden.  
This is because the target hiding mode is "Hide elements".

Some people may want to hide only `Apples`.  
Let's try to change the hiding mode.

1. Open EmoGuard.
2. Open the Keywords tab, add `Bananas` to the keyword list.
3. Go to the Target tab, then click on the URL in the `Target` field and select `All Sites`.
4. Find the CSS selector item called `li` and click on it.
5. Click on the left icon and select `Hide text matching keywords`.

Now you have changed the hiding mode from `Hide elements` to `Hide text`!  
If you go back to the fruit list, you will see that only the part of the keyword you specified is hidden.

You can flexibly adjust the hiding mode in this way.

## Add CSS selectors

Sometimes elements are not well hidden even after adding keywords.  
Open EmoGuard and add `Grapes` to the keyword list.

<Box rounded={'md'} boxShadow={'md'} borderWidth={'1px'} bg={'white'} p={5} my={5}>
  <span>
    <foo>üçá Grapes are purple</foo>
  </span>
</Box>

Perhaps there was no response of any kind.  
Why is that?

```html
<span>
  <foo>üçá Grapes are purple</foo>
</span>
```

If you look at the HTML, it is obvious that the uncommon HTML tag `<foo>` was used here.  
EmoGuard supports a CSS selector called "Default CSS Selector" by default.  
The Default CSS Selector supports the `<span>` tag, but not the special tag `<foo>`.

### Solution

- Add a new CSS selector.
- Change the keyword search range of an existing CSS selector.

There are several solutions, but let's try the former first.

1. Open EmoGuard.
2. Add a new CSS selector by typing `foo` in the `Enter any CSS Selector` text field on the Target tab.

<Box rounded={'md'} boxShadow={'md'} borderWidth={'1px'} bg={'white'} p={5} my={5}>
  <span>
    <foo>üçá Grapes are purple</foo>
  </span>
</Box>

Congratulations! This time it was well hidden.

There are a wide variety of websites in the world.  
You may encounter pages that cannot be handled by EmoGuard's default settings.

Don't worry. You can add CSS selectors to deal with it.

<Alert status="info" variant="left-accent" my={5}>
  <AlertIcon />
  The Targets tab allows you to add CSS selectors to either "All Sites" or individual sites. CSS selectors
  added to "All Sites" will be used on all websites. If you add it to an individual site, it will only
  work within that site.
</Alert>

<Alert status="info" variant="left-accent" my={5}>
  <AlertIcon />
  If there are duplicate CSS selector values for "All Sites" and an individual site, the individual site's
  settings will be used. This is useful when you want to override the "All sites" settings on another
  site.
</Alert>

## Customize the keyword search range

Remember the previous solution.

- Add a new CSS selector.
- Change the keyword search range of an existing CSS selector.

Now let's try the latter approach.

Next we want to hide `Oranges`.  
For the sake of the tutorial, we have prepared a special tag called `<bar>`.

Open EmoGuard and add `Oranges` to the keyword list.

<Box rounded={'md'} boxShadow={'md'} borderWidth={'1px'} bg={'white'} p={5} my={5}>
  <span>
    <bar>üçä Oranges are orange</bar>
  </span>
</Box>

```html
<span>
  <bar>üçä Oranges are orange</bar>
</span>
```

It is still not well hidden. (That's the intent)

Earlier we added a new CSS selector, which was simple and straightforward.  
Why do we need another method?

HTML has an incredibly nested element structure.  
You may try to add `bar` to the CSS selector list as before, but what if the following new HTML appears?

```html
<span>
  <bar>
    <baz>üçà Melons are green</baz>
  </bar>
</span>
```

What a mess!  
You have just added `bar` and now you have to add `baz` as well.  
Soon after, you will realize that there is no end to this struggle.

To be able to block keywords as you wish, you will have to confront this HTML nesting structure.

Rest assured, we have a way.  
EmoGuard provides two modes for keyword searching: `Shallow search` and `Deep search`.

- Shallow Search: Search for keywords **in the direct text of element** matching the CSS selector
- Deep Search: Search for keywords **in the text of elements and its descendants** matching the CSS selector

<Alert status="info" variant="left-accent" my={5}>
  <AlertIcon />
  Deep search can only be selected when the hide mode is set to `Hide text matching keywords`.
</Alert>

The reason `Oranges` was not hidden earlier was because the target CSS selector was set to `Shallow search`.  
Shallow search targets only the text directly below the element, but directly below the `<span>` tag is the `<bar>` tag, not the text `üçä Oranges are orange`.

Deep search that searches through all descendant elements would likely find `Oranges` successfully.

1. Open EmoGuard.
2. On the Target tab, click on the URL in the `Target` field and select `All Sites`.
3. Find the `span` CSS selector entry and click on it.
4. Click the search icon in the middle and select `Deep search`.

<Box rounded={'md'} boxShadow={'md'} borderWidth={'1px'} bg={'white'} p={5} my={5}>
  <span>
    <foo>üçä Oranges are orange</foo>
  </span>
</Box>

Congratulations! This time it worked.

Now nested elements are no longer a problem.

<Alert status="warning" variant="left-accent" my={5}>
  <AlertIcon />
  By default, most CSS selectors are assigned `Shallow search`. Although `Deep search` may seem more
  convenient, heavy use of `deep search` can easily corrupt the display of web pages. Please use `deep
  search` only when necessary.
</Alert>

<Alert status="info" variant="left-accent" my={5}>
  <AlertIcon />
  If the web page is not displaying properly, you can reset the Default CSS Selector on the options page.
</Alert>

## Good work!

This concludes the tutorial.  
We recommend that you reset the Default CSS Selector on the Options page to restore the settings you changed in this tutorial.
